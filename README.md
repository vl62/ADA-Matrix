## Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix (ADA-M) Objective and Scope

ADA-M provides a standardized way to represent any and all consent and other conditions of use that apply to a resource, making such information unambiguous, computer-readable and hence directly available for digital communication, searching and automation activities.

## ADA-M Profile

ADA-M Profile is therefore a form of structured metadata (i.e., data about either data or an object annotated by data) which is useful in that it can facilitate the effective communication of use conditions, or provide the basis for the discovery of these conditions, or increasingly automate decisions around granting access based on these conditions.

## ADA-M tool

A software approach to create a valid ADA-M Profile has been made and compiled versions of the tool for both Mac OS X and Windows users.
